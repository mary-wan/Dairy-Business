                <p>PrideFarms is a dairy business producing milk on daily basis and supplies to Brookside company for processing. <br><br>

                    In many dairy farms I have visited in the country, I have not heard any farmer talk of his dream making enough 
                    money from cows to build rental houses around their farm or a plan to sell their products in the next town or 
                    country, but that’s exactly what can happen when well-intentioned dairy business owner spend time planning the 
                    future of their farms <br><br>
                    
                    One challenge with business planning is that plans can be written with 
                    the best of intentions. In the farms I have visited I have only seen one 
                    farm -in Kasarani have a written strategic plan. To be fair to our farms, 
                    I have only visited a fraction of farms but the fact that one out of the 20 
                    plus mid/large scale farmers only one has a plan is worrying. <br><br>
                    
                    Many middle income families stay in Nairobi or other towns. 
                    They have good education and may find it easy to identify great 
                    ideas and opportunities in dairy farming. Most of them have access to finance. 
                    The challenge is that since their expertise is in other sectors not necessarily dairy, 
                    they many not understand how to execute their ideas. The fact that information on dairy
                     sector is still “closed” makes investors to perceive it as high risk <br><br>

                    While farmers see processors like Brookside and KCC like enemies that harm profitability 
                    and impose prices on dairy farmers, you need to change your thinking from focusing on processors
                     to what you can do differently to grow business. In Kenya the challenge farmers face is scale and 
                     cost of production. Presence of established Processors is what makes dairy farming in this country 
                     viable-they offer stable market. Think about it, would we have the same outcome with Quails if we
                      had a processor even half powerful than their dairy counterparts? I doubt.</p>
